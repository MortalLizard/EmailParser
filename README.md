# Custom File Parser for Structured Data Processing

## Overview

This module provides a robust solution for parsing files into structured objects. Designed to handle various file types such as `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.json`, it converts raw file inputs into structured and readable data formats for further analysis or use in other applications.

The file parser is flexible, modular, and scalable, supporting multi-line and nested structures in the input data. It can process large data sets by leveraging streaming techniques, ensuring that memory usage is optimized during execution. The parser is implemented in a stepwise fashion, progressing through different stages, including reading, parsing, and output generation.

## Components and Workflow

### 1. Input Handling
The parser accepts different file types as input, providing a flexible interface for data ingestion.

#### Supported Input Types
- `.txt`: Plain text files with simple or complex data structures.
- `.csv`: Comma-separated values, parsed into structured key-value pairs.
- `.json`: JSON files with arbitrary depth and complexity.

The input files are read and processed into manageable data chunks using a combination of buffered reading and streaming techniques. This allows the parser to work efficiently with large files without requiring them to be loaded entirely into memory.

### 2. Tokenization and Lexing
Once the input file is read, the data is passed through a tokenization process. The lexer identifies tokens based on the structure of the file (e.g., fields, separators, line breaks).

Example: Tokenization for a `.csv` file:

Input:
```csv
Name, Age, Occupation
John Doe, 29, Software Engineer
```

Tokenized Output:
```json
[
    { "type": "header", "value": "Name" },
    { "type": "separator", "value": "," },
    { "type": "header", "value": "Age" },
    { "type": "separator", "value": "," },
    { "type": "header", "value": "Occupation" },
    { "type": "linebreak", "value": "\n" },
    { "type": "field", "value": "John Doe" },
    { "type": "separator", "value": "," },
    { "type": "field", "value": "29" },
    { "type": "separator", "value": "," },
    { "type": "field", "value": "Software Engineer" },
    { "type": "linebreak", "value": "\n" }
]
```

### 3. Parsing and Validation
The parsed tokens are validated to ensure they adhere to the expected structure. Depending on the input type, different parsing rules apply. For instance, a `.csv` file would expect consistent field separators and row structures, while a `.json` file would validate nested keys and values.

Parsed Output:
```json
{
    "header": ["Name", "Age", "Occupation"],
    "rows": [
        { "Name": "John Doe", "Age": 29, "Occupation": "Software Engineer" }
    ]
}
```

### 4. Data Transformation and Structuring
Once the tokens are parsed and validated, they are transformed into structured objects. This includes creating key-value pairs, converting data into dictionaries, or generating nested objects for complex JSON data.

For example, a `.json` file might be transformed as follows:

Input:
```json
{
  "person": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 29,
    "occupation": "Software Engineer"
  }
}
```

Parsed and Structured Output:
```json
{
  "person": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 29,
    "occupation": "Software Engineer"
  }
}
```

### 5. Output Generation
The final step in the pipeline is output generation. The parser generates structured data in the format needed for the next stage of the process. This could involve producing reports, exporting structured JSON data, or transforming the data for use in machine learning models or analytical processes.

#### Supported Output Formats
- JSON
- CSV
- Structured dictionaries or objects

### 6. Streaming Data Processing
The parser is designed to handle streaming input. For large files, the tokenization and parsing steps are performed incrementally to reduce memory overhead and support real-time data processing.

### Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the file parser to process a `.csv` file.

```javascript
const { FileParser } = require('file-parser');

// Create an instance of the parser
const parser = new FileParser();

// Define the path to the input file
const filePath = 'path/to/your/file.csv';

// Parse the file and output the structured data
parser.parse(filePath)
    .then((result) => {
        console.log('Parsed Data:', result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error parsing file:', error);
    });
```

For streaming data:

```javascript
const { FileParser } = require('file-parser');

// Create a stream to read large files in chunks
const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('path/to/large/file.csv');

// Pipe the file stream into the parser
fileStream.pipe(parser.stream())
    .on('data', (chunk) => {
        console.log('Processed chunk:', chunk);
    })
    .on('end', () => {
        console.log('File processing complete.');
    })
    .on('error', (error) => {
        console.error('Error processing file stream:', error);
    });
```
